## Things I learned/practiced in the process
- Working with props
- Using Array.map to make my component work with data provided, if new data is added to the array, another component will be added automatically.
- Importance of each element Array.map will work on to have a unique key
- Destructuring at work again

## Challenges
- CSS Media query not working, all solution from Google is involving installing or adding a package which I don't want to use for now.
